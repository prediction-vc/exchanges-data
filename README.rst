Ways to improve and expand:
    1) Including more top volume cryptocurrencies (right now the number is 29)
    2) Make this a multi-threaded script, to improve performance as it is meant to run every minute
    3) Error handling and logging should be done more thoroughly, for the cases where the exchange is down
        or it stopped supporting certain trading pairs etc.
